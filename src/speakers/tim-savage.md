I am currently the development lead for Westpac Databank.

Got interested in Python around 2003-2004 by reading and absorbing the Python Cookbook, over the next 15 years Python has become my main language. Along the way, I have written Python applications for the likes of Fairfax Media, Woolworths, Westpac as well as several small startups. I contribute to many Python (and non-python) opensource projects including publishing several of my own modules, notably, Odin and PyApp.

Outside of programming, am a multi-instrumentalist, play drums in multiple bands in and around Sydney, have an interest in electronics. Have my hands kept full with twin daughters!
