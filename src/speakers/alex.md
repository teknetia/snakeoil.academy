“Alex” (@mangopdf) does Red Teaming, recently completed Operation ACTUAL CRIMES, and can’t wait until they’re inevitably struck down by their own hubris.

They’re known for hacking a friend (with consent!) in Operation Luigi, being an organiser for purplecon.nz (a defensive, inclusive, pastel-purple security conference) and for writing dumb blog posts on mango.pdf.zone. They’re also known for exposing a privacy flaw in Tinder, and showing it was possible to make graphs of when your Facebook friends are awake.

At PyCon AU, they’ll be wearing their Sunday best emotionally, and hence or otherwise tryign their bset.
