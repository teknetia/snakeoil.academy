A technologist, public speaker, and community builder, Ben is passionate about sharing his ideas and views on security, identity, and privacy. In what spare time remains, he spends time with his family in Melbourne, Australia, and finds too many excuses to get out the soldering iron or dig trenches for the next fully-automated life hack that will hopefully one day save him time.
