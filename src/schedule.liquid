				</div>
				<p><strong>Lucie Krahulcova</strong></p>
				<p class="mb-1">Governments around the globe accept technology as a one-stop-shop solution promising the future socially, economically... nothing that can't be improved or solved with a tech unicorn! But what are the costs that come with embracing technology as the solution to every analogue issue? The COVID19 crisis has laid bare the challenges of public trust, confidence and expectations that individuals have of technology. In this session we will look at how a perfectly tailored technical solution can impact individual's rights and liberties; and discuss the design parameters to mitigate such impacts.</p>

				<p><strong>Yaakov Smith</strong></p>
				<p class="mb-1">What exactly is contact tracing, and how can Bluetooth help to slow the spread of a pandemic? How can I balance my own privacy with communal health? Can a simple app actually make it safe to go back to the football?</p>

				</div>
				<p><strong>Carina C. Zona</strong></p>
				<p class="mb-1">Biometrics are widely regarded by the public, and many developers, as heightened security. Their actual track record tells a very different story. Biometric technologies are systematically making the world a less safe place. We have an obligation to do something about that. And we can.</p>

					<h5 class="mb-1">Deceptive Security using Python</h5>
					<p><span class="badge badge-primary">13:20 - 13:45</span></p>
				</div>
				<p><strong>Gajendra Deshpande</strong></p>
				<p class="mb-1">Imagine you are passing through an unknown street at midnight and you find that some anti-social elements are following you. To save yourself from them you start running and look for a safe place to hide yourself. On the way, you will find a good person and request the person to help you. The person hides you in the secure place to protect you. When these anti-social elements visit a good personâ€™s place and enquire about you, the good person misguides them and redirects them to some other place in order to protect you. This is exactly how deception works. In this analogy, YOU are the resources to be protected, anti-social elements are the hackers who want to gain access to the resources, and a good person is a deception technique that protects the resources from hackers by making them fall in the trap.</p>

				</div>
				<p><strong>Markus Holtermann</strong></p>
				<p class="mb-1">We live in a world of technology. Unfortunately, the software we build has bugs and sometimes vulnerabilities that cause headaches and haunt us at night. It is on us as engineers to not make security issues in the first place. But it is on everybody involved to provide support when an issue exists.</p>
