excerpt: "In this talk we are going to do the time warp back to the 1930’s and see what the General Drafting Co. can teach us about securing data and breach notification and how to apply them in the modern day. Using free and OSS I show you that security isn’t all about expensive 3rd-party products and SOCs."

What does the little town of Agloe, Colchester, NY have in common with modern day data protection? Why when I look for directions to Agloe, Colchester, NY do I only get a partial match? And what do yellow small birds have to do with anything?

In this talk we are going to do the time warp back to the 1930’s and see what the General Drafting Company can teach us about securing data and breach notification and how to apply these concepts in the modern day. Using free and open-source solutions I’ll show you that information security isn’t all about expensive third-party products and Security Operations Centers’ (SOC), rather, by using some defensive thinking and a bit of creativity, with your exisiting infrastructure and services you too can easily identify data breaches, and catch the bad guys in the act with the tools you already use in your own environment. Come along for a lesson on the anatomy of the canary.
