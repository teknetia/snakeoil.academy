buckle up kiddo weâ€™re gonna commit digital sin If you steal someoneâ€™s Chrome cookies, you can log in to their accounts on every website theyâ€™re logged in to.

Normally you need the userâ€™s password to do it, but I found a way to do it without the password. You just need to be able to execute code on their computer. It works by using Chromeâ€™s Remote Debugging Protocol. To my knowledge this is the only way to extract a userâ€™s Chrome cookies without their password, and by far the easiest way.

It involves plugging together several extremely forbidden and undocumented Chrome features, as well as figuring out how to speak the websocket protocol stealthily on a victimâ€™s machine.

This talk is about how the technique was found, how it works, and what you can do with it.
