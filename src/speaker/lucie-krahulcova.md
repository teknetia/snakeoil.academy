Lucie is a professional activist and human rights researcher. She has spent the last five years working for Access Now, an international digital rights ngo working on defending and extending the rights of users at risk. There she campaigned for strong encryption, against the proliferation of targeted-spyware, and for strong government policies which empower and support individual rights and liberties in the online world. She has a background in international relations and security studies, and she's never lived in any city longer than 4 years.
