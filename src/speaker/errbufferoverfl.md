Rebecca is a “white rabbit” hacker by day and a Python developer by night, she loves good looking code, poisonous plants and spending time dreaming up new security tools that eventually (someday) get published. She also suffers a chronic case of refactoring syndrome and checklist-itis. In Rebecca’s post-hacker life she worked for SaaS providers trying to make information security and policy more accessible and fun, giving workshops on lock-picking and vulnerability management. If left unattended too long she will resume her Pavlovian-style training to get people to improve security practices. Her favourite member of One-Direction is the one with the best passwords.
