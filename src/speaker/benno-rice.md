Hi, I’m Benno and I’ve done a few things.

I’ve been a member of the FreeBSD core team, I co-created Behave, I ported FreeBSD to the PowerPC and I get far too interested in politics and especially elections.

I currently work at Yubico and have previously worked at iXsystems, Dell EMC and a bunch of other places doing everything from FreeBSD kernel development to Python application development to management and occasionally all three at once.
